Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines, sail away from teh safe harbor, catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. â€”Mark Twain

I am working on managed database service @ Compose.io helping startups focus on creating apps.
I am gopher first and python enthusiast second but do not try to limit myself to langauges.
I spend my spare time working on open-source libraries.
